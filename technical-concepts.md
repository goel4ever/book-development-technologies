### Programming Fundamentals 101

**Object Oriented Programming** -

**Functional Programing** - more flexible, makes testing and debugging easier

Core concepts:

1. Immutability
2. Stateless

Functional Concepts

1. Pure Functions - a function where the return value is only determined by its input values, without observable side effects
2. Map, Reduce, Filter - Array helper methods, which take in functions and do not mutate the original array
3. Currying - technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each of a single argument

**Imperative Programming** -

Pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its input values, without its observable side effects.

Note:

* JS allows all three styles of programming
* React brings these functional programming concepts to UI
