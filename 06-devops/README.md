# DevOps

Anything and Everything related to maintaining a software once you have the bundle created. This includes CI/CD, automated unit testing and decided where and how to deploy, and much more...

DevOps is integration of development, quality assurance and operations. Automation of builds, changes , provisioning, testing and operations is what builds up process automation. Small and frequent releases. Bugs not allowed in the build.

#### Continuous Delivery

Core foundation of DevOps.

* Automated Build & Deploy
  * SCM/Version
  * Build Scripts
  * Dependency Map
  * Component Deploy
  * System Deploy
* Automated Testing
  * Test Scripts
  * Test Deploy
  * Load/Soak Scripts
  * Data Provisioning
  * Baseline/Benchmark
  * Testing Reports
* Automated Provisioning
  * Image Management
  * Patch Management
  * Auto Env Deploy
  * Start/Stop Scripts
  * Rolling Upgrades
  * Security Configuration

#### Continuous Testing

Sits between Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery. Automate as much as you can, so testing occurs on click of a button.

* Confirm desired functionality
* Catch programming syntax errors
* Standardize code patterns and format
* Reduce bugs
* Make applications more secure
* Make sure to include
  * Security testing
  * Performance testing
  * Integration testing
  * Logging and automated feedback
  * Template management
  * Layered testing, including regression and unit testing

#### Continuous Integration

Ability to perform Coding, Planning, Measuring, Operating, Deployment, Release, Test, and Building over and over again. This is more about reducing latency and being able to leverage technology for instant feedback.

Key goals are:

* Find and address bugs quicker
* Improve Software quality
* Reduce the time to validate and release software updates

#### Continuous Deployment

Focused on automating the delivery of systems. Brings tighter working relationship between development, operations and the end user.

## DevOps Process

# Cloud Computing

There is no one cloud fits all solution. Pick cloud deployment models after understanding your workload.

#### Cloud Deployment Models

* Private - More secure. You own the hardware and run the cloud on premises. 
* Public - Elastic scaling. Leveraging cloud services over internet using software and hardware that you do not own.
* Hybrid - Seamless. Mix of both

#### Types of Cloud

* Saas - Finished application you rent and customize over the internet. Removes the need for organizations to install and run hardware and software within their own data centers and eliminates software/hardware provisioning and licensing.
  Replaces enterprise applications. Cheaper way to consume enterprise applications such as CRM and ERP.
  * Salesforce.com
  * Google Apps
  * Microsoft 365
* IaaS - Deployment platform that abstracts the infrastructure. Third-party provider hosts hardware, software, servers, storage and other infrastructure components on behalf of the end user. Hosts infrastructure services found in a traditional data center such as compute, storage, etc. Also provide application and data hosting for existing enterprise workloads. Can host private, public and hybrid deployment models.
  Designed to replace Storage and Compute services. Cheaper platform for applications and data.
  * AWS \(Storage & Compute\)
* PaaS - Deployment platform that abstracts the infrastructure. Cloud version of application development and deployment. Reduce application development and deployment cost. Third-party provides a platform allowing users to develop, run and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure themselves.
  Cheaper ways to build web-based systems that enforce standards.
  * Google App Engine
  * AWS's Elastic Beanstalk
  * Microsoft Azure
