# Cheatsheet

Area where you'll find quick references to common commands related to few technologies. 

Here are couple ways that I would look for answers:

```
1. Original docs. They are the best, may or may not be written very well, but usually give you everything required.
2. MacOS App - Dash (collective documentation of multiple languages)
3. Personalized docs. What I have here. I find it fastest approach for me.

So, whatever works, is the best for you. You'll need to figure that out by experience.
