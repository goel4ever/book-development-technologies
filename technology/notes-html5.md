> Facade: An extremely thin layer of abstraction around the native api. It is not a polyfill. Nor does it add functionality on top of existing apis. Main goal is to have thin layer of insulation across the production code.

If you use native api in your code and a breaking change is introduced, you'll have a bunch of places to go and change into, however facade is like a pressure release value. Framework is just a more complex version of facade. They add all kinds of extra stuff into it like polyfills, etc.
