# Protocols

When it comes to application development, all of the communication is done on either TCP or UDP or even both protocols. Both of these protocols are at Transport layer level.

Transport Layer





TCP - Transport Control Protocol. Connection-oriented. Data delivery is guaranteed.

UDP - User Datagram Protocol. Connection-less. Data delivery is not guaranteed.

* SNMP \(Simple Network Management Protocol\)

Both

List of Protocols

* Ethernet Protocol - Link
  * IP - Internet
    * UDP - Transport
    * TCP - Transport
      * HTTP - Application
      * POP3 - Application
